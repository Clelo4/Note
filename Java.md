### What is an Object?
An Object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life. 
### What is a Class?
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This section defines a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object.
### What is Inheritance?
Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.
### What is an Interface?
An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface.
### What is a Package?
A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. Placing your code into packages makes large software projects easier to manage.
