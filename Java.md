# Java

## Essential
* ***The main Method***: In the Java programming language, every application must contain a main method whose signature is:
``` Java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

## Learning the Java Language
### What is an Object?
An Object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life. 
### What is a Class?
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This section defines a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object.
### What is Inheritance?
Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.
### What is an Interface?
An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface.
### What is a Package?
A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. Placing your code into packages makes large software projects easier to manage.

## Language Basics

### Variables
* Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)
* Class Variables (Static Fields)
* Local Variables
* Parameters

### Naming
* Variable names are case-sensitive.
* Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters.
* If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters.
* If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. The names gearRatio and currentGear are prime examples of this convention.
* If your variable stores a constant value, such as static final int NUM_GEARS = 6, the convention changes slightly, capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character.
